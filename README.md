# Requirements
Requirements for building libjpeg-turbo can be found [here](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-requirements).

If you are using homebrew, NASM must be installed with `--devel` because of a [bug](https://sourceforge.net/p/libjpeg-turbo/mailman/message/34219546/) in NASM 2.11.08 (e.g. `brew install nasm --devel`)

# Test images
